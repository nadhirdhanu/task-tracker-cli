## 📦 Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-cli.git
cd task-cli
```

### 2. Install and link globally

```bash
npm install
npm link
This makes the CLI available globally as task-cli.
```

## 🛠️ Usage

### Add a new task

```bash
task-cli add "Buy groceries"
# Output: ✅ Task added successfully (ID: 1)
```

## 📁 Data Storage

Tasks are stored in a local tasks.json file in the current working directory. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created automatically.

Each task includes:

- id: Unique identifier
- description: Task details
- status: todo, in-progress, or done
- createdAt: Timestamp when task was added
- updatedAt: Timestamp when task was last modified

## 🧯 Error Handling

The CLI gracefully handles:

- Invalid task IDs
- Unsupported status values
- Missing arguments
- Empty task lists

## 🧪 Example Workflow

```bash
task-cli add "Write documentation"
task-cli mark-in-progress 1
task-cli update 1 "Write detailed documentation"
task-cli mark-done 1
task-cli list done
```
